# Handling Imbalanced Data with Basic Classifier Models


## Summary
In this project, I am examining how a Logistic Regression and a Decision Tree classifier model can be optimised if the underlying data is imbalanced.

This GitHub repo contains my code for my [blogpost on Medium](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/handling-imbalanced-data-with-basic-classifier-models-5ce3d61874f1). 


## Files
- `imbalanced_classifier.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the majority of the work and visualisations. 
- `imbalanced_classifier_functions.py`: Contains functions and useful methods written for this project.
