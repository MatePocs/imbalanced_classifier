# Classifier Models with Imbalanced Data

In this project, I am examining how a Logistic Regression and a Decision Tree classifier model can be optimised if the underlying data is imbalanced.

- `imbalanced_classifier.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the majority of the work and visualisations. 
- `imbalanced_classifier_functions.py`: Contains functions and useful methods written for this project.
